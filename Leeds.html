      <p>Leeds is a big city in West Yorkshire, northern England. It doesn’t have its own state symbols, but Yorkshire’s famous white rose represents the region. Local wildlife includes red squirrels, owls, and foxes in the countryside nearby. Leeds is led by a city council and is part of the wider Yorkshire county system.</p>
      <p>During the Industrial Revolution, Leeds grew quickly and became known for its wool and textile industries. Many mills and historic buildings still stand today, like Kirkstall Abbey, a beautiful medieval ruin.</p>
      <p>Tourists often visit Kirkstall Abbey (small entry fee, open daily), the Royal Armouries Museum (mostly free), and Leeds Art Gallery (free or low cost). The city’s Victorian shopping arcades and parks are also fun to explore.</p>
      <p>For food, the city centre has cafés for coffee and sandwiches (open 9–17), pubs around Call Lane with burgers and steaks (£10–20), and in Headingley, there are Indian and Thai restaurants (£12–22).</p>
      <p>Fun fact: Leeds has more Victorian arcades than any other UK city and is one of the fastest-growing cities in Britain today.</p>
