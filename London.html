    <h1 class="title">Explore London</h1>
    <div class="info-box">
      <p>London is the capital of both England and the UK. Its symbols include the red and white rose of England and two dragons on its coat of arms. Wildlife such as squirrels, foxes, pigeons, and songbirds live all over the city. London has a Mayor, the Greater London Authority, and is the centre of the UK’s parliamentary system.</p>
      <p>London’s history goes back to Roman times, when it was called Londinium. Big events like the Great Fire of 1666 and the Blitz during World War II have shaped the city.</p>
      <p>Must-see attractions include the British Museum (free), the Tower of London (~£30, open 9:00–17:30), Westminster Abbey (~£25, 9:30–15:30), the London Eye (~£30, 11:00–18:00), and the National Gallery (free).</p>
      <p>To eat, try cafés in Covent Garden (sandwiches, £10–20, open 8:00–20:00), restaurants in Soho with world cuisines (£15–35), or old pubs in Westminster serving British meals like pies or fish & chips (£12–25).</p>
      <p>Fun facts: The London Underground is the world’s oldest subway (opened in 1863), over 300 languages are spoken in the city, and “Big Ben” is actually the bell, not the clock!</p>
