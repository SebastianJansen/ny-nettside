    <h1 class="title">Explore Bristol</h1>
    <div class="info-box">
      <p>Bristol sits in southwest England and is famous for its harbour. The city’s symbol includes a ship, showing its strong link to sea trade. Seals and seabirds can sometimes be seen around the harbour. Politically, Bristol has its own mayor and council.</p>
      <p>Historically, Bristol was a major port for trade and exploration. The SS Great Britain, built by Brunel, is now a museum ship that shows the city’s maritime past.</p>
      <p>Tourist highlights include the SS Great Britain (entry around £18, open 10:00–17:00), Clifton Suspension Bridge (free to visit, small fee for the visitor centre), and Bristol Museum & Art Gallery (free). Also, Aerospace Bristol (£15) displays real airplanes and Concorde.</p>
      <p>For dining, try cafés by the Harbourside with seafood and sandwiches (£10–18, open 11:00–16:00), stylish bistros in Clifton (£15–30), or local pubs downtown serving pies and fish & chips (£9–20).</p>
      <p>Fun fact: Bristol is the home of the mysterious street artist Banksy and won the title of European Green Capital in 2015 for its focus on sustainability.</p>
