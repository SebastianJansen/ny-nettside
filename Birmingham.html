    <h1 class="title">Explore Birmingham</h1>
    <div class="info-box">
      <p>Birmingham is found in the West Midlands, right in the heart of England. The city doesn’t really have an official flower or animal, but its coat of arms shows a bull’s head and an eagle. You can often see swans, ducks, and sometimes even foxes in the city’s green parks. Birmingham is run by a city council with a mayor, under the UK’s national government.</p>
      <p>Back in the Industrial Revolution, Birmingham grew from a small town into one of Britain’s most important cities for metalwork and factories. Inventors like James Watt and Matthew Boulton lived here, and the old Jewellery Quarter still keeps some of that history alive.</p>
      <p>If you visit, check out the Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery (free entry for main exhibits), Cadbury World (tickets around £20–25), or the Back to Backs, showing how workers lived long ago. The canals and Sutton Park are great for walks too.</p>
      <p>Eat at cafés in the Jewellery Quarter (open 9–17), restaurants near Broad Street (£12–25), or classic pubs with dishes like fish & chips (£8–18).</p>
      <p>Fun fact: Birmingham actually has more canals than Venice, and almost 40% of its people are under 25!</p>
