    <div class="info-box">
      <p>Liverpool is a lively port city in northwest England, sitting by the River Mersey. It doesn’t have an official state bird or flower, but the city’s symbol—the liver bird—is unique and appears on its crest. The city has its own council under the UK government.</p>
      <p>Liverpool became famous for trade and shipping in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was one of the biggest ports for goods and migrants, and of course, it’s known worldwide as the home of The Beatles.</p>
      <p>Popular attractions include The Beatles Story museum (tickets about £15, open 10:00–17:00), the Royal Albert Dock (free to explore, though museums inside may charge), Anfield Stadium tours, and the Museum of Liverpool (often free).</p>
      <p>For food, try seafood spots at Albert Dock (£15–25, open 11:00–late), cosy cafés in the Georgian Quarter with brunch and cakes (open 8:00–16:00), or pubs around Ropewalks and Bold Street serving British food and local ales (£10–20).</p>
      <p>Fun fact: Liverpool is a UNESCO City of Music and has more museums and galleries than any city in the UK except London.</p>
