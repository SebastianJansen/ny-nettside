    <div class="info-box">
      <p>Manchester is in northwest England and is known for the worker bee, its famous city symbol that represents hard work and industry. Around the region, you can find animals like foxes, badgers, and many types of birds. The city is part of Greater Manchester, with its own mayor and council.</p>
      <p>Manchester played a huge role in the Industrial Revolution and became the heart of the cotton and textile industry. The Manchester Ship Canal and old mills still show that history. One important event here was the Peterloo Massacre in 1819, which helped push for more political rights.</p>
      <p>Main attractions include the Manchester Museum (free), Science and Industry Museum (free or small fee), Old Trafford stadium tours, and the John Rylands Library (free).</p>
      <p>For food, check out cafés in the Northern Quarter for brunch and coffee (9:00–17:00, £8–15), restaurants near Deansgate with Italian and Asian food (£15–30), or pubs in Castlefield and Spinningfields (£10–20).</p>
      <p>Fun fact: Manchester is called the world’s first modern city. The first computer program ever stored was created here!</p>
